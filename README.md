# NASA Photo of the Day

A simple web app that shows NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## About This Project

This was built as a solo project to practice working with APIs. It lets you browse through NASA's space photos by picking different dates. I wanted to make something cool that actually uses real data from NASA.

## What It Does

- Shows today's space picture when you load the page
- Lets you pick any date to see that day's picture
- Shows the title, date, image, and description for each picture
- Works on mobile phones too
- Shows loading messages and error handling

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS (with Google Fonts)
- JavaScript
- NASA APOD API

## How to Run It

Download the files and open index.html in your browser.

## What I Learned

This was my first time working with an actual API. I learned how to:
- Use fetch() to get data from an API
- Handle errors when the API doesn't work
- Update the page based on user input
- Make the site work on different screen sizes
